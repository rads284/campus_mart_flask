[{"id": 1, "name": "Operating System", "credits": "4", "description": "This course will introduce the core concepts of operating systems, such as processes and threads, scheduling, synchronization, memory management, file systems, input and output device management and security. The course will consist of assigned reading, weekly lectures, a midterm and final exam, and a sequence of programming assignments. The goal of the readings and lectures is to introduce the core concepts. The goal of the programming assignments is to give students some exposure to operating system code. Students are expected to read the assigned materials prior to each class, and to participate in in-class discussions.", "image": "assets/linux.jpeg", "documents": ["Operating_System.pdf", "lecture_note_440507181044270.pdf", "Operating_System_Fundamentals.pdf", "Operating_System_Tutorial.pdf", "slides.dvi.pdf", "UNIT-1.pdf"], "videos": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i2N_Qo_FyM", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTQ8zym8Au0"]}, {"id": 2, "name": "Web Technologies", "credits": "4", "description": "The focus in this course is on the World Wide Web as a platform for interactive applications, content publishing and social services.
